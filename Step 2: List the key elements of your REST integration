Before you even start drafting a strategy for connecting various data objects, you should sort out some other important aspects of the process of REST API integrations. Itâ€™s a good idea to set up a checklist so that you know what information you need to gather upfront. This checklist should answer questions such as:

Are there any restrictions on the payload
What are the provided authentication methods
What is the allowed number of requests per unit time
Is there SSL certificate validation
What are the traffic encryption requirements
Are there any specific headers that a request should contain
Does the vendor provide a test server or any other way to perform a test request, and how you get access to that
