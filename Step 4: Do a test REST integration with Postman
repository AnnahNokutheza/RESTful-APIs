Once you’ve gathered all the supporting information you could find and set up a mapping plan, you may take an extra step and run a test with a 
specific business process, e.g. executing an order fulfillment, on Postman, – with the specifications of a corresponding REST API, 
checking the most common use cases with various datasets. In other words, you would simulate what the application will do later automatically.

You’d be surprised but such a test run can reveal up to 70 percent of documentation inaccuracies at the very early stages of the REST 
integration development. For example, the documentation said that a certain endpoint will accept JSON whereas in reality, it expects form-data.
Or the rules for field validation are specified incorrectly.

You can then collect the errors you received and if you find no obvious reason for them, send them to the developers of the respective REST API 
for further clarification and correction.

Of course, using Postman is just one option out of several. Maybe you can get access to a test server with API or there is a mechanism that allows 
to send test requests to the production server.
