I’m sure you already know that no two REST APIs are the same, so even before you start thinking about data flows – meaning how exactly you plan to move datasets between applications and web services – you need to establish whether REST API integration is feasible in the first place and make a rough estimation of how much time you need to plan for it.

There is one thing you should check upfront: Does the application you want to integrate with provide good documentation? Solid documentation is the backbone of any automation project using APIs; in fact, it can be considered as one of the characteristics of a good API. Ideally, it should provide you with detailed information on how to format your requests, what kind of endpoints are available, what endpoints you need to evoke this or that business process (e.g. payment processing), give you plenty of code examples, and much, much more. Without it, integrating REST will be challenging and resource-intensive.

An example of such great documentation is VTEX REST API reference; saying that it is excellent is an understatement. Unfortunately, for many, many API documentations this is not the case, but this is a different story.
